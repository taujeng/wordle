# wordle WORDLE

Making my own version of wordle so that I can add my own features.

Plan on hosting my version on a custom domain.

To Do:

- [x] backspace also applies to boxes, not just values
- [ ] prevent zoom in on mobile
- [ ] add animations for boxes upon submission
- [ ] add functionality to header buttons
- - [x] X button to close pop up
- - [ ] hamburger
- - [ ] question: wordle rules
- - [ ] stats
- - - [x] local storage
- - [ ] settings
- [ ] check if submissions are actual words
